# Rotate_a_Number

🔁 Definition: Rotation of a Number
Rotation of a number is the process of shifting its digits left or right in a circular manner. Digits that go off one end are brought back around to the other end, maintaining the total number of digits.

📌 Types of Rotation:
1. Left Rotation (n-)
Shifts the digits to the left by n positions. The leftmost digits wrap around to the right.
	•	Example: Original: 21453 Rotation: 2- → Left Rotate by 2 Result: 45321
2. Right Rotation (n+)
Shifts the digits to the right by n positions. The rightmost digits wrap around to the left.
	•	Example: Original: 21453 Rotation: 2+ → Right Rotate by 2 Result: 53214

🔤 Note:
	•	Rotation is circular; digits are not lost.
	•	Input format like "2+" means "rotate right by 2", while "2-" means "rotate left by 2".
